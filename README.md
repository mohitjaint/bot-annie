Intended to create something smart that could move, but turned up with a blind differential drive with a slow brain and absolutely no sense of direction (blud literally runs into walls and blames the programmer). 



So here's Baldev. The star of the Technical Orientation 2024, of IIITDMJ. 



TL;DR: The "brains" of Baldev are powered by 'dolphin-mistral:7b' run via 'ollama' locally. The #LLM then generates twist messages and a the time for how long the twist message shall run. It's a half baked concept, but hey, it works!
